# Wage Timer

## About

Are you an hourly employee?  Have you ever wanted to see yourself slowly earn money, second-by-second?  Well, now you can with this handy Wage Timer!

Input your wage and hit "Start".  You'll see your income go up every second.

It will also work with negative numbers, so if you want to see how much money you are costing something, just put a negative sign, '-', in front of your number!

Have fun!
